# Fleet Assignment Optimisation Project

This project involves optimising the assignment of aircraft types to flights for British Airways (BA) on 1st September 2019. The goal is to minimise the total cost of assigning aircraft types to flights while ensuring that demand is met, each flight gets assigned exactly one aircraft and the fleet size is respected. This repository presents a comparative study of three optimisation techniques applied to the fleet assignment problem: **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**, **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)**. 
## Project Structure

The repository is organised into the following directories:

### 1. `Data Preprocessing and Exploration/`

This folder contains the jupyter notebook used for:
- Importing and cleaning raw data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Conducting basic statistical analysis and visualisation
- Preparing the data for modelling

### 2. `Code for Model development/`

This folder includes the implementations of the three optimisation models:
- `Integer_Linear_Programming_Model.py` 
- `Genetic_Algorithm_Model.py` 
- `Ant_Colony_Model.py` 

Each script encapsulates the relevant optimisation logic, objective functions and constraint handling specific to the chosen technique.

### 3. `Output/`

This folder contains the outputs generated by the three models, including:
- actual_aircraft_assignment.csv (not by model)
- integer_programming_assignment.csv 
- genetic_aircraft_assignments.csv
- ant_colony_assignment.csv


### 4. `Result Analysis/`

This folder includes the analysis of the output generated by the models. The comparative graphical and tabular analysis which was done in MS Excel is available in this section.
